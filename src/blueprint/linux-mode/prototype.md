# The prototype

*What has been verified by running code, what each run showed, and what has not been verified at all. The chapter's claims are only as strong as this page.*

## What was built, at a glance

| what | shows | standing |
|---|---|---|
| **Hello World on the design's real path**: the Asterinas tree's 100-line kernel, source unchanged, as a kernelet in a patched Linux 6.12 | the gate, carriers and the root carrier, kernelet stacks, `user_run`, the model and the cache, tenant copies by walking the model, entry and exit | *measured on the booted prototype*, [below](#hello) |
| **A probe kernel on the same prototype**: demand paging, an illegal instruction, and a kernel that spins forever | a real miss in the model and the kernel proper's fix; an exception taken from Linux's signal queue by the resume hook; **eviction** of a carrier that will not leave kernelet code; the lifeline; the fill/flush machinery over one file per model; service calls on the Linux stack | *measured on the booted prototype*, [below](#probe) |
| **A busy kernel on a Linux booted with `preempt=none`** | the watch timer and the yield stub: a kernelet that never volunteers is rescheduled anyway, and resumes intact | *measured on the booted prototype*, [below](#yield) |
| **The software walk, in a model** | the cost the design adds to every tenant copy, and that the supervisor alias does not earn its risks | *measured in a model*, [below](#walk) |
| **Earlier mechanism experiments** (in a Linux 6.12 guest) | shared text for many instances; the cost of a gate; Linux's refusal of executable `vmap` memory; SMAP's refusal of direct tenant access; recovery from a kernel-mode fault by die notifier | *measured on the booted prototype of each mechanism*, [below](#earlier) |
| **The second-level scheduler**: a 1,100-line kernel with a strict-priority scheduler of its own on two virtual CPUs, against a reference model; the mirror with and without; a sibling control group's share; a kernelet task switch beside Linux's | the policy holds exactly and preempts; zero preemptions inside critical sections; the neighbor's share within 1.2 % whether the sandbox runs 1 or 50 tasks; a task switch of about 1,000 cycles | *measured on the booted prototype*, [below](#sched); the 2 ms bound was measured in its earlier form |
| the function-entry stack check, the die notifier on a kernelet's own fault, the vsyscall filter, multi-instance loading of a real image, device models and device threads, channels, the runtime, more than one kernelet, more than two virtual CPUs, the next-expiry hook | nothing | **[unverified]**: designed, not built |

The three booted rows were built on an earlier form of the design, in which every kernelet task had a Linux task of its own as its carrier and a virtual CPU was a lease called a *seat* ([why that lost](alternatives.md)). What they show about the gate, the stack switch, the model and the cache, exceptions, eviction, the lifeline and the yield stub does not depend on that difference; where a log or a table below says *seat* or `task_spawn`, that is why.

No full kernelet, meaning the Linux-compatible kernel proper with its file systems and network stack, has run on Linux. What has run is a small kernel written against the same OSTD interface, which uses the interface's hardest parts.

## Hello World on the design's real path {#hello}

**The test.** The Asterinas tree has a teaching example, [a kernel in about 100 lines of safe Rust](https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/blob/main/book/src/ostd/a-100-line-kernel.md). It allocates frames, copies a user program into them, builds an address space and maps the frames into it, creates a task, enters user mode with `UserMode::execute`, and services two system calls, `write` and `exit`. Small as it is, it uses the parts of OSTD's interface that are hardest to provide on Linux: tasks, a tenant address space, user-mode entry with a returning `execute`, and fallible reads of tenant memory.

**The rule.** The kernel's source file is copied from the tree (commit `ab9a4cfdc`) and the build compares it byte for byte with the original before every run. Only its `Cargo.toml` differs: the dependency named `ostd` resolves to the prototype's vOSTD. If an OSTD item could not keep its path or signature on Linux, that would be a finding. None needed to change.

**The layers**, as built, in a git worktree of the Asterinas repository under `kernelet-linux/`:

| layer | what it is | size |
|---|---|---|
| kernel proper | the 100-line kernel, unchanged, `deny(unsafe_code)` | 136 lines of Rust, 18 of assembly for the user program |
| vOSTD | a Rust crate whose library name is `ostd`, offering the items that kernel uses with their real signatures. It calls no Linux symbol: the linked image has zero undefined symbols | 2,408 lines |
| image ABI | a service table and an entry table of C function pointers, and boot arguments | in both of the above |
| endovisor | one Linux module in C: the program loader and root carrier, carriers by `kernel_clone()`, the stack switch, the gate's two hooks, the memory areas and their fault handler with the model walk and the grant check, lifelines, eviction, the watch timer and yield stub, the services | 2,675 lines |
| the gate | a patch to Linux v6.12 | 103 added lines in 8 files, none removed |
| runtime | a static test program that forks, sets *no new privileges* and executes the sandbox file | 154 lines |

**The run.** Linux 6.12.0, built from `tinyconfig` plus a fragment (SMP, full preemption, modules, seccomp, control groups, address-space randomization), patched, booted in QEMU with hardware virtualization and two processors. One command, `make hello`, builds everything, boots, and checks the serial log. This is the log from the module's loading on; one line is left out, Linux's notice that an out-of-tree module taints the kernel:

Read against the design, line by line:

- *root carrier exec*: the runtime's child executed a file beginning with the magic `KLET`; the endovisor's [binary-format handler](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#root) claimed it and emptied the address space.
- *boot carrier*, *task carrier*: two `kernel_clone()`s by the root carrier, one per OSTD task. Each is a separate Linux process (pids 33 and 34).
- *activated the model at 0x803000*: `VmSpace::activate` became `pt_activate`; the root of the kernel proper's page table is a frame of the grant (which starts at 0x800000), and nothing was written to the processor's page-table register.
- *user window*: on the user task's first `user_run`, one memory area covering the user range, created with `vm_mmap()`.
- *cache fill*: the tenant's first instruction fetch faulted in Linux; the endovisor's handler walked the model, checked the frame against the grant, and installed the translation. There is exactly one fill, although the program's message is on another page: the kernel proper read the message [by walking the model](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#copies), which involves no Linux page table at all.
- *syscall 1 serviced by the kernelet*, *Hello, world*: the [gate](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md)'s syscall hook switched to the kernelet stack, `UserMode::execute` returned `UserSyscall`, and the kernel proper's own handler printed the buffer with `println!`, which is the `log_write` service. Linux's `write` was never called.
- *stopped, exit code 0*: `power::poweroff` became the `stop` service; every carrier was killed, each carrier's lifeline closed as Linux tore the task down, the module's reference count reached zero, and the module unloaded.

The checks (`Hello, world`; exit code 0; clean unload; no `BUG:`, `Oops`, `WARNING:` or `Call Trace` in the log) passed on three consecutive runs of the final tree.

**Two paths not on the hello kernel's route were forced, once each, with temporary instrumentation that was then removed.** A forced *model miss* on the first fault made the handler record the fault and return; the resume hook resumed the kernelet with `user_run` returning *exception* (trap 14); the kernel proper ignored it and called `execute` again; the second fault was filled and the program ran to completion. A forced `tlb_shootdown` between the two system calls removed the cached translation, and the log shows it being filled again on the next instruction fetch.

**What the prototype does not have**, and therefore does not show: more than one kernelet, more than one seat, the position-independent loader (the image is linked into the module), the die notifier, the function-entry stack check, the user-mode tick, the FS base and floating-point paths, devices, channels, a real runtime, and control-group accounting of the grant. Its Rust heap is Linux's `kmalloc`, where the design puts the heap in the grant. Implemented but never executed: the write-protection callback, the "present but not permitted" flavor of a model miss, and the refusal of non-64-bit entries. The sizes in the table are of the final tree, which includes the [probe kernel](#probe)'s additions.

## A probe kernel: demand paging, an exception, and eviction {#probe}

Hello World never misses in the model, never faults, and exits politely. A second small kernel, written for the purpose in safe Rust against the same vOSTD (190 lines, `deny(unsafe_code)`), does the three things it does not. It was run after the prototype had been brought in line with what review changed in the design: the rule that the kernel proper hears only of faults taken in user mode, protections built by the handler, one file per model with `unmap_mapping_range()` as the flush behind a per-model lock, service calls on the Linux stack, and a lifeline per carrier. The log below is an excerpt: lines that repeat Hello World's start-up and shutdown are left out, and one long symbol name is shortened.

```

**Demand paging.** The kernel maps only the program's text. The program stores to an unmapped address. The log shows the [six steps of the memory page's figure](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#cache): a miss in the model, reported to the kernel proper as a page-fault exception with the right address and an error code that says *user, write, not present*; the kernel proper's handler mapping a fresh frame with the ordinary cursor; the translation installed; and the program reading its own data back.

**An exception that is not a page fault.** The program executes `ud2`. Linux forces `SIGILL`; the gate's resume hook takes it off the signal queue before Linux can deliver it, recognizes it as kernel-generated, and `user_run` returns *exception* with trap 6 from the task's thread structure. The kernel proper logs it and steps over the instruction. One thing the design had not said was found here: for an exception that arrives as a signal, the hook must first copy the saved user registers into the context, as the syscall hook does, because the context still holds the registers of the previous trip.

**Eviction.** The kernel proper's handler for system call 1000 is `loop {}`. The test then kills the root carrier from outside. The root's lifeline closes, the endovisor marks the kernelet dying and kills the other carriers, and the spinning carrier, which no signal can reach, is [evicted](faults-and-reclamation.md#eviction): a timer callback on its processor finds the interrupted instruction pointer inside the kernelet image, at depth 0, in a dying kernelet, and points it at the exit stub. The carrier leaves through the ordinary stack switch, gives up its seat, and dies by the pending `SIGKILL`; the module's reference count reaches zero and it unloads. Eight runs evicted eight times, in one or two sweeps each, on either processor, with no complaint from Linux. The interrupted instruction was always one of the loop's two instructions, as Linux's own symbol lookup confirms in the log. The stub realigns the stack pointer, because an interrupt can land between any two instructions.

Three smaller results came with it. Linux's own kernel-mode read of a carrier's user memory (`get_user`, forced from the endovisor for the test) filled the cache on a hit and returned `-EFAULT` on a miss, without the kernel proper hearing of either. `unmap_mapping_range()` on a model's file did remove raw-frame-number translations, and the next access refilled them. And a service call through the stack-switching stub cost 18 cycles against 10 for a direct call in one boot and 26 against 26 in another (*measured on the booted prototype*, 2,000 calls, interrupts off): the pair of stack switches costs under ten cycles.

What this still does not show: eviction under load, with many carriers, or of code that is in the middle of something subtler than a spin; and none of the items in the last row of the table at the top.

## Yielding on a Linux that does not preempt kernel code {#yield}

Review found that on a Linux booted not to preempt kernel code, a busy kernelet would never be rescheduled, and the design answered with the [watch timer and the yield stub](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#yield). Both were then built and tested on the same prototype, with the same kernel image booted with `preempt=none` (Linux's log confirms `Dynamic Preempt: none`).

The test kernel's system-call handler, in safe Rust, runs 800 million rounds of a checksum through ten live 64-bit variables, about eight seconds. A competing host process, pinned to the same processor, counts and reports every quarter of a second.

| | watch timer off | watch timer on |
|---|---|---|
| longest gap between the competitor's reports | 4,294 to 4,313 ms | 263 to 274 ms |
| yield-stub invocations | 0 | 807 to 864 |
| the kernelet's checksum | `0x0a9daca3b668810c` | `0x0a9daca3b668810c` |
| the same computation in user space | `0x0a9daca3b668810c` | `0x0a9daca3b668810c` |

Five runs with the timer on. The kernelet was interrupted more than 800 times at arbitrary instruction boundaries, moved to the Linux stack, rescheduled, and resumed, and not one bit of its result differs. With the timer on, the competitor ran at exactly half its solo rate: an even split.

Two things were learned on the way. The first design for re-arming the timer, "only while it interrupts kernelet code", collapses, for the reason now given on the [tasks page](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#yield). And the review's worry that a busy kernelet would also stall Linux's RCU is not true of Linux 6.12: a process on the other processor completed grace periods at the same rate with the watch timer off as on, through an 8.6-second monopoly, because Linux's tick reports a quiescent state for kernel code that holds no RCU read lock and has preemption enabled. The harm of a missing yield is starvation of one processor, not a machine-wide stall.

## The walk, measured {#walk}

The design replaces a direct dereference of tenant memory with a software walk of the [model](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#copies) followed by a copy through Linux's direct map. Before adopting it, its cost was measured against the two alternatives, in user space on the development machine (Intel Xeon E3-1270 v6, Linux 6.8, gcc 11 `-O2`, one pinned core; medians of five runs).

**The model.** A four-level page table in hardware format was built in user memory, with its nodes placed at shuffled positions so that the walk gets no locality a kernel would not have, over a synthetic process layout of up to a million mapped pages. The walk is four dependent loads with a present-bit test at each level, compiled in its own unit so that the compiler cannot fold it away.

**The three ways to copy.** One set of pages was mapped three times: a *tenant* mapping with 4 KiB pages; an *alias*, a second 4 KiB mapping, standing for the supervisor alias; and a *direct map* on 2 MiB pages, standing for Linux's. A "tenant" touch of a random page in a working set of W pages was followed by a copy of L bytes out of that page, by each route.

| | W = 64 pages | W = 4,096 | W = 262,144 |
|---|---|---|---|
| a walk alone, random page | 3.6 ns (15 cycles) | 4.7 to 5.3 ns | 13.3 ns (55 cycles) |
| a walk alone, its four entries flushed from cache first | about 300 ns | about 300 ns | about 300 ns |
| copy 16 B: direct / alias / **walk + direct map** | 2.6 / 4.7 / **12.1** ns | 2.6 / 8.4 / **13.2** ns | 2.6 / 17.4 / **23.7** ns |
| copy 4 KiB: direct / alias / **walk + direct map** | 81 / 81 / **89** ns | 245 / 266 / **265** ns | 289 / 373 / **362** ns |

The copy figures have the measurement harness's own 9 ns subtracted. The alias took one more hardware page walk per operation than the direct route (*measured* with the processor's TLB-miss counter); the walk-plus-direct-map route took 0.15 more. For scale, one `getppid` system call on the same machine, with its speculative-execution mitigations, took 479 to 497 ns.

**What this decided.** The walk adds about 10 ns to a small copy and nothing measurable to a large one, so the model stays as designed. The supervisor alias would save about 7 ns on small copies with a small working set, and nothing with a large one, because the second set of 4 KiB translations it needs costs TLB misses that the 2 MiB direct map does not. That does not pay for writing page-table entries Linux believes it owns, so the alias is [rejected](alternatives.md). An 8-entry cache of recent leaf tables in front of the walk recovered about 5 ns in the small case, and with a realistic address-space layout and a larger working set its hit rate fell below 10 percent and it was slower than the plain walk. It was left out.

**What this does not show.** It is a model in user space on one machine, not vOSTD in a kernel. The 256-byte cells at the largest working set varied by a factor of two between runs on this shared machine and are not quoted. The sources, the commands and every table are in the prototype's `kernelet-linux/bench/`, with the raw output in `RESULTS.md`.

## Earlier experiments {#earlier}

Nine experiments were run while the design was being worked out: six numbered ones on the mechanisms this design uses, fault recovery, and two on designs that were [rejected](alternatives.md). Two machines were involved, and their numbers are never compared with each other. The **build host** is the development machine above, where a bare system call costs about 485 ns. The **guest** is Linux 6.12.0 built from `tinyconfig` plus what a virtual machine and loadable modules need, booted under hardware virtualization on that host; a bare system call there costs 44 ns, because the configuration has none of the mitigations. Read the differences, not the ratios: a floor ten times lower flatters every ratio.

**1. Two instances of one image.** The same module source, built under two names and loaded together: each copy had its own data at its own address and ran its own initializer. Linux refuses a second copy of a module by name only. *Shows:* relocating one image twice gives two independent sets of globals.

**2. One physical text page, four instances.** One page of position-independent machine code (`mov rax, [rip+d]; ret`), mapped four times with `vmap()`, each mapping followed by a different data page:

```
picdemo: one text page, pfn 0x76d
picdemo: instance 0 image at ffffc9000001d000  data at ffffc9000001e000  text pfn 0x76d
picdemo: instance 1 image at ffffc90000015000  data at ffffc90000016000  text pfn 0x76d
picdemo: instance 2 image at ffffc90000025000  data at ffffc90000026000  text pfn 0x76d
picdemo: instance 3 image at ffffc9000002d000  data at ffffc9000002e000  text pfn 0x76d
picdemo: call through instance 0 returned 0xda7a0000 (want 0xda7a0000) ok
picdemo: call through instance 1 returned 0xda7a0001 (want 0xda7a0001) ok
picdemo: call through instance 2 returned 0xda7a0002 (want 0xda7a0002) ok
picdemo: call through instance 3 returned 0xda7a0003 (want 0xda7a0003) ok
picdemo: RESULT PASS
```

*Shows:* the whole of the [loading scheme](builds-and-images.md#sharing). It needed `set_memory_rox()` to be exported: the first attempt executed from a plain `vmap()` range and Linux reported `kernel tried to execute NX-protected page`. With the export, the text's page-table entry read `W=0 X=1`.

**3. The cost of a gate.** One program, in the guest, timed with the cycle counter; medians of five runs.

| path | median | over a bare call |
|---|---|---|
| a call Linux services itself (`getppid`) | 44 ns | — |
| Syscall User Dispatch, no kernel change | ≥ 929 ns | + 885 ns |
| a per-task hook that returns a constant | 39 ns | below the noise |

The hook measured below `getppid` because its servicer did no work. What the row shows is that a hook adds nothing measurable to Linux's entry path. That hook sat in x86-64's own entry code; the [gate](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md) is in the generic layer one call further in, and its cost with the stack switch and the seat is **not measured**. On the build host, seccomp user notification cost 5,721 ns per call and `ptrace` 8,221 ns, against 1,887 ns for dispatch there.

**4. Where relocations land.** A Rust static library with the shapes a kernel image is full of, linked as a kernelet image would be: `.text` 274,307 bytes and `.rodata` 64,914 bytes with no relocations; 181 in `.data.rel.ro` and 119 in `.got`, all of the one base-relative type. *Shows:* 98 percent of the read-only material can be shared. It is a synthetic library, not the kernelet image.

**5. Indirect-branch markers.** With the compiler flag that asks for them, the library's entry function began with the landing marker that hardware control-flow enforcement checks. *Shows:* the compiler half of [assumption A19](builds-and-images.md#audit). The kernel half is open.

**6. Can kernel-mode code touch a tenant address?** Six cases, in the guest, with SMAP on, each in a forked child so that a fatal case does not end the run:

```
smap_test: the cell holds 5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a at 0x4c70f0
  bare read        -> child KILLED by signal 9
  module-bracketed -> OK
  copy_from_user   -> OK
  direct-map alias -> OK
  bracketed, bad   -> child KILLED by signal 9
  bad, with fixup  -> OK          (smapdemo: recovered from the fault, fail=-14)
```

*Shows:* a bare kernel-mode read of a mapped, present tenant page ends the task; the same frame read through the direct map needs nothing; and setting the processor flag around the access works for a good address and is fatal for a bad one unless Linux finds a recovery entry, which it does only for its own code and for modules. This is the experiment behind [never dereferencing a tenant address](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#copies).

**Fault recovery by die notifier.** In the same series, a module registered a die notifier that recognized a fault in its own text, moved the saved instruction pointer, and answered `NOTIFY_STOP`; the faulting process survived, twice, and a full oops was printed each time. A divide error in kernel mode was survived the same way. *Shows:* the mechanism of [fault containment](faults-and-reclamation.md#fault), and its price.

**Two rejected designs, measured.** A supervisor-only alias of a tenant's page table was built: a bare kernel-mode read through it succeeded where the same read through the tenant's address was fatal, at 0.92 cycles per access against 1.08 for an ordinary kernel address and 38 for Linux's bracketed `get_user`; its cost in TLB entries is what [the model above](#walk) measured later. And one Linux task was made to carry two tenant threads, swapping register file, thread pointer and floating-point state 400,000 times: a switch cost 291 ns more than a serviced call that stays on one thread, 91 ns of it floating-point state. A third figure quoted among the alternatives comes from the same series: code run in kernel mode of a hardware-virtualized guest, on the build host, paid 792 ns (3,002 cycles) for an exit and resume, and its second level of address translation cost nothing measurable while translations were resident and a factor of 1.20 on memory access at a working set too large for the TLB.

The programs and unedited transcripts of these experiments were in the book's notes until this chapter replaced them; they are in the repository's history.

## The second-level scheduler {#sched}

The fourth phase rebuilt the prototype on the architecture of the [Scheduling](virtualizing-ostd/scheduling.md) page and ran four experiments against it, one per property the design promises. Everything below is *measured on the booted prototype*, on the same two-processor Linux 6.12 guest, with the sandbox in a control group of its own.

**What changed underneath.** A carrier now carries a virtual CPU; the endovisor has no `task_spawn`, no seats and no job queue. vOSTD's task layer, scheduler interface, context switch (`switch.S` byte for byte), spin locks, wait queues and preemption guards are OSTD's own at `ab9a4cfdc`, ported verbatim; what was written new is the virtual CPU: the record, the upcall stub, the mirror, `vcpu_idle`, `vcpu_kick`, the kernelet-stack pool, the two floating-point services, and `kernelet_switch_mm()`. The pre-linked image still has zero undefined symbols. Of the three OSTD prerequisites the design names, the prototype implemented the two preemption points and not the next-expiry hook, so an idle virtual CPU wakes at every tick.

**The test kernel.** `sched/`, 1,100 lines of safe Rust with `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`, injects a scheduler of its own through OSTD's `inject_scheduler`: strict priority in three levels, round robin within a level on a five-tick slice, a run queue per virtual CPU, and wake-ups that follow the waker unless the task is pinned. It is deliberately not the FIFO scheduler OSTD ships, so that a policy Linux cannot express is what the trace has to show. The three older kernels, `hello/src/lib.rs` still byte-identical to the tree's, pass unchanged on the new architecture; `make yield`'s checksum is still bit-identical after 3,936 upcalls.

### The policy is obeyed, and it preempts

Two virtual CPUs, six kernel tasks and two tenant threads, three seconds: 1,842 task switches and 49 cross-CPU wake-ups, every one of which the kernelet's own scheduler decided and Linux never saw. The trace is checked by a reference model in user space (`bench/sched-model.py`) that asserts *legality*, not one particular interleaving: a task runs only where it is pinned; never while a more urgent task is runnable on that virtual CPU; never twice in a row while a peer waits; never past its slice plus one tick; and a task woken into a more urgent level takes the processor within a tick and slack. No violation in three consecutive runs.

One rule had to be restated on the way (*found by the prototype*): the slice is exact in the virtual CPU's *own* ticks and elastic in wall clock. A five-tick slice measured seven milliseconds once, because Linux had the carrier off the processor for two of them, and a virtual CPU that is off the processor gets no ticks. That is the honest shape of a second-level guarantee, and the [Scheduling](virtualizing-ostd/scheduling.md) page now says so.

### Cooperative: no preemption inside a critical section

Four kernel tasks, nothing pinned, hammering one spin lock for ten seconds while two competitors in a sibling control group on the same two processors make Linux preempt the carriers constantly. The endovisor counts, exactly, every time Linux switches a carrier out involuntarily while the kernelet's contribution to Linux's preemption count is provably in place.

| | mirror on | mirror off | overstayer, mirror on |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| involuntary deschedules inside a critical section | **0** | **1,467** | **0** |
| spin-lock acquisitions | 267 M | 270 M | 88 M |
| forced yields | 0 | 0 | **1,301** |
| longest deferral of a Linux preemption | — | — | **2,205 µs** |
| the sibling group's processor time over the run | 10.02 s | 9.97 s | 9.96 s |

A repeat gave 0 against 1,068. The mirror is exactly what makes the difference, and it costs the neighbor nothing. The *overstayer* is a task that holds a preemption guard for 10 ms in a loop: it is forced to yield 1,301 times, no stay exceeds 2.2 ms, and its sandbox's own processor time falls from 9.87 s to 9.12 s, which is what "borrowed, not stolen" has to mean. The count is zero with nothing pinned, so the carriers were preempted and migrated between the two processors throughout, which is the case the first watch-timer rule got wrong. (This run predates the review that made the bound independent of the record; the prototype forces the yield on the second tick that finds a critical section with Linux waiting.)

### Fair: the neighbor's share does not move

The sandbox's group and a sibling with equal weight, both confined to two processors. The sibling runs busy loops; the sandbox runs one processor-bound kernelet task, then fifty at mixed priorities, then fifty plus the overstayer.

| | 1 task | 50 tasks | 50 + overstayer |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| the sibling's share, in processors | **0.988** | **0.998** | **0.987** |
| runnable tasks of the sandbox Linux ever saw at once | 3 | **3** | **3** |
| kernelet stacks the pool made | 4 | 53 | 54 |
| forced yields | 0 | 0 | 460 |

The spread is 1.19 %. Three is the whole argument: two carriers and the root carrier, whether the kernelet has one runnable task or fifty. The first version of this check compared absolute processor seconds across runs of different length and reported a 29 % spread that was not unfairness (*found by the prototype*: strict priority makes the fifty-task run four seconds longer, and both groups get proportionally more); shares are what may be compared.

### Efficient: what a kernelet task switch costs

Five boots, several thousand samples each, medians of the per-boot medians, on a 3.79 GHz counter.

| measurement | median | p99 |
|---|---:|---:|
| two kernelet kernel tasks yielding to each other on one virtual CPU, round trip | **2,056 cycles, 542 ns** | 993 ns |
| a blocked high-priority kernelet task woken by a low-priority one on the same virtual CPU, until it runs | **1,558 cycles, 411 ns** | 840 ns |
| two Linux processes on one processor calling `sched_yield()`, round trip | 3,504 cycles, 924 ns | 1,809 ns |
| a Linux pipe write waking a process on the other processor | 41,386 cycles, 10.9 µs | 4.4 ms |

The first two rows are the design's numbers: a kernelet task switch, scheduler decision included, costs about 1,000 cycles, on a virtual CPU that Linux is meanwhile scheduling normally. The Linux rows are a scale, not a baseline: the Linux pair makes two system calls and changes address space, which the kernelet pair does not, so 542 against 924 ns is not a speed-up claim; and the pipe row's p99 is the cost of competing with the sandbox's own carriers for two processors. Two measurements the design asked for produced no samples in the kept runs and are **[unverified]**: a wake-up *across* virtual CPUs (the mechanism is exercised 49 times in the policy run, and the model asserts each was served within a tick, but no cycle count), and a switch between tenant threads of different processes (exercised 1,267 times below, without a cycle count). The floating-point swap: two tenant threads in two address spaces on one virtual CPU, each keeping four values in vector registers across every trip through the kernel, 518,501 check-ins, 1,037,002 save-load pairs and 1,267 address-space adoptions, not one value lost and, past four times the processor count, no leak of concurrency ids.

### What phase 4 found

Building it changed the design in these places, each folded into the page named.

1. **The mirror must be idempotent, because OSTD's guard lifetimes cross a context switch.** `switch_to_task` takes a guard and the *next* task releases it, so the pairing of increment and decrement holds across tasks and virtual CPUs, not within one function; a first build decremented once too often, took Linux's count to −1, and was caught by the endovisor's range check. The flag `mirrored` in the record makes both operations idempotent, set *after* the increment and cleared *before* the decrement so that the flag never claims more than the count holds; with the flag on the other side of the instruction, the cooperative experiment counted the two-instruction window itself and reported 165 "failures" that vanished when the store moved ([Scheduling](virtualizing-ostd/scheduling.md#cooperative)).
2. **The watch timer's per-processor pointer was a hole**, found in review and confirmed here: a carrier that Linux preempts inside kernelet code resumes without passing any way in. Preemption notifiers replace it ([Tasks](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#watch)).
3. **`kernelet_switch_mm()` leaks a concurrency id per adoption unless it does what `exec` does around its swap**, and the leak is invisible on a kernel without restartable sequences, which the first guest was. With the brackets in place, 1,267 adoptions past four times the processor count leaked nothing. The helper also has to consume the caller's reference and return the old address space, because a task's exit drops one unconditionally. It is 29 lines of code, and the patch grew from 103 to 169 added lines ([The endovisor](endovisor.md#patch)).
4. **`masked` became two fields**, a guard count and a virtual interrupt flag, because a single one would have meant a kernelet holding a spin lock received no ticks ([Scheduling](virtualizing-ostd/scheduling.md#upcall)).
5. **The floating-point save had to move.** The first build saved a tenant thread's state where the kernel proper's own hooks place it, before a task switch, and lost values on the first check-in; saving at the return from user mode and loading before the return to it fixed it. The prototype attributes the loss to kernelet code using vector registers, which the kernelet target (`x86_64-unknown-none`, soft float) should preclude, so the cause is **[unverified]** and the design keeps the kernel proper's placement, which `CpuSync` chooses; the prototype's deviation stands until it is explained.
6. **A model's area is created under a lock of its own**, since the fault path takes the model's semaphore inside Linux's address-space lock and `vm_mmap()` takes that lock inside the caller's ([Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#interlock)). The fill/flush semaphore was contended by two virtual CPUs for the first time and held; the case it exists for, a flush concurrent with a fill, is still only argued.
7. **`vcpu_idle` has a protocol and there is no `timer_arm`**, since OSTD has only a periodic tick ([Interrupts and time](virtualizing-ostd/interrupts-and-time.md)). The prototype raises TICK on every wake from idle.
8. **`user_run` marks the carrier as leaving before it reads the pending word** ([User mode](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md#user-run)).
9. **The upcall stub needs a section of its own**, or the linker places it below the image's text and the load-time check refuses the module, which is what the check is for.
10. **`enable_preemption_on_cpu()` must be the last thing `main` does**, and an injected `enqueue` must not ask to preempt a virtual CPU that merely has no current task, since the bootstrap context has none either; both are OSTD's shape, not Linux's.

**Where the prototype still differs from the design.** It keeps the interrupted instruction pointer in the record rather than on the interrupted stack, and reads `stack_limit` for the 32 KiB rule, both of which the review changed afterwards; it re-normalizes and warns on a bad excess where the design kills; it sends the kick's cross-processor call synchronously, which is legal there because nothing raises a line from a hardware interrupt; `vcpu_on_spin` never fired, since no critical section here lasts a thousand failed spins, so that path and `yield_to()` are untested; the next-expiry hook is not implemented; more than two virtual CPUs and more than one sandbox at a time are not exercised; and the `sched` kernel's own scheduler briefly offered one task to two virtual CPUs a handful of times, which OSTD's context switch refused as it is written to, so the invariant held but that scheduler is not proved free of it.

## Findings {#findings}

Building the prototype changed the design in ten places. Each finding below has been folded into the page named, so the design and the prototype agree; the last column of the table after it records where the *prototype* still differs from the design, which are its shortcuts and not open questions.

1. **OSTD's address-space activation is per CPU, and the 100-line kernel relies on it.** Its `main` activates the address space, and a *different* task enters user mode. With activation recorded per task, which is what both hosts need, that task would have no address space. A new task therefore inherits its creator's activation, weakly, until it activates one of its own ([Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#cache)). The finding applies to the Asterinas host too.
2. **`Task::yield_now()` from the boot context must not return while tasks exist.** On a machine it never does. The first prototype returned at once, and the start-up code that follows `main` powered the kernelet off before its task had run ([The rest](virtualizing-ostd/the-rest.md)).
3. **Linux grants write permission behind a fault handler's back.** A write to a cached read-only translation does not call the area's `fault` function; without a `pfn_mkwrite` callback Linux simply makes the entry writable. The endovisor must supply that callback and consult the model in it ([Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#cache)).
4. **A read or fetch that violates a cached translation's permissions never reaches the area at all.** Linux raises `SIGSEGV` directly. The design already turns forced signals back into exceptions in the resume hook, so the case is covered, by that path and not by the fault handler ([Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#cache)).
5. **Inserting a translation over an existing one silently does nothing.** So the handler must always install the model leaf's *full* permissions, never only what the faulting access needed, or the next wider access would fault forever.
6. **Module lifetime is not quite automatic.** Linux's per-address-space reference on the program loader's module is dropped before the last reference to the area's file is, and the file's release ran in unloaded code, once. The file operations must name the module as their owner ([Tasks](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#root)).
7. **Every carrier inherits the root carrier's saved registers**, including its segment selectors and flags, because a clone that starts in a kernel function copies its parent's register file. The root carrier must therefore initialize its own as a 64-bit user task even though it never reaches user mode ([Tasks](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#root)).
8. **A Rust image for Linux's module loader needs `-Z plt=yes`.** Without it the compiler reaches its own helper functions through a global offset table, 1,593 relocations of a kind the loader rejects. This affects the prototype's build only; the design's [position-independent image](builds-and-images.md) is loaded by the endovisor, not by Linux's module loader.

9. **An exception that arrives as a signal finds a stale context.** On a model miss the fault handler runs with the user registers already saved by Linux, and so does the resume hook; but the *context* the kernelet sees was last written on the previous trip. The hook must copy the saved registers into it before resuming the kernelet, exactly as the syscall hook does ([User mode](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md#exceptions)).
10. **A cloned carrier inherits its parent's lifeline.** A clone without shared descriptors gets a *copy* of the root carrier's table, so the root's lifeline would stay open until the last carrier died. Each new carrier closes the inherited copy first ([Tasks](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#death)).

**Reproducing it.** In the worktree, `cd kernelet-linux`, then `make hello`, `make probe` and `make yield`. From a clean checkout the first run downloads the Linux 6.12 release tarball, unpacks it under `.build/`, applies the patch and builds the kernel. `REPORT.md` there lists every deviation and surprise met on the way, about sixty in all, most of them engineering.
