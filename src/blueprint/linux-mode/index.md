# Kernelets in Linux

*The same kernelets, with Linux as the host kernel. An operator keeps the kernel they already run, applies a small patch, loads one module, and selected workloads get a kernel of their own in safe Rust. This chapter is the complete design, written to be read alone. A prototype of its central mechanisms runs a kernel whose source is unchanged from the Asterinas tree, inside a patched Linux 6.12.*

The kernelet calls the endovisor only through the service table. Linux's page tables for the carriers are filled from the kernelet's model by the endovisor's fault handler.">

## The idea in five sentences

A kernelet is a complete Linux-compatible kernel, written in safe Rust against a small framework interface, and it touches the machine only through that interface ([background](kernelets-in-brief.md)). Nothing in that arrangement says who implements the interface, so Linux can. A tenant's threads are ordinary Linux tasks, and a small patch to Linux's entry path, **the gate**, hands each of their system calls to their kernelet before Linux would look at it. The kernelet keeps its own page tables for its tenant's processes, and Linux's page tables are filled from them on demand, by a fault handler that checks every frame against what the kernelet owns. Everything else a kernel needs (threads, timers, memory, devices) maps onto what Linux already exports to modules.

## What it asks of Linux

| it asks for | which is |
|---|---|
| a patch | **the gate**: one pointer in the task structure, one flag bit, and two calls in the generic entry layer, which x86-64, RISC-V, s390 and LoongArch share |
| exported symbols | **four**: `kernel_clone`, `set_memory_rox`, `set_memory_rw`, `set_memory_ro` |
| a module | the **endovisor** |
| of the operator | not to configure the machine to panic on an oops |
| not needed | a boot parameter, hardware virtualization, any change in behavior for tasks outside a sandbox; nor a particular preemption model: where Linux does not preempt kernel code, the endovisor [reschedules kernelet code itself](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#yield) |

The details and the patch itself are on [the endovisor page](endovisor.md#patch). An unpatched Linux is ruled out, by function and not by speed: without the gate a tenant's second process would make its system calls to Linux.

## What a tenant gets

The three properties the book's boundary owes a tenant, as they stand on this host ([Boundaries and trust](principles.md) has the argument):

- **Safety**: held. The tenant's only kernel is its kernelet. No system call, by any entry instruction, from any thread or child, reaches Linux.
- **Fault containment**: held for the kernelet's own code. A kernelet that faults, panics, overflows its stack or loops forever ends, and only it ends. A failure inside a service call is a bug in the host, on this host as on the other.
- **Fairness**: held for processor time and memory, by Linux's own control groups, because every task and every page of a kernelet belongs to its sandbox's group. Interrupt-time work that a tenant's I/O induces is charged as Linux charges it for any process.

And what it costs: Linux's own correctness is in the trusted base, as it is for a container; a process's threads do not share Linux page tables, so first touches of memory are paid per thread; and copying to or from tenant memory costs a software page-table walk where the other host pays nothing ([Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#copies) has the measurement).

## What has been built

A prototype of the central mechanisms, not the endovisor. On a Linux 6.12 with the gate patch, a module carrying a minimal vOSTD runs the Asterinas tree's 100-line example kernel **with its source byte-for-byte unchanged**: the kernel builds a tenant address space, runs a user program in it, services its `write` and `exit` system calls, and prints *Hello, world*. That exercises the gate, carriers and the root carrier, kernelet stacks, the model and the cache, and tenant copies by walking the model. A second small kernel on the same prototype shows demand paging through a real miss in the model, a tenant exception taken from Linux's signal queue, and **eviction**: a kernel that spins forever in kernel mode, which Linux alone could never kill, is removed and its sandbox reclaimed. Earlier experiments established the shared-text loading scheme, the cost of the gate, fault recovery by die notifier, and the processor's refusal of direct tenant access. The [prototype page](prototype.md) says exactly what each run showed and what remains unverified: most importantly the device models, the multi-instance loader and the stack check, none of which has been built.

## How to read the labels

Every number says where it came from: *measured on the booted prototype*, *measured in a model*, *measured on the tree* (the Asterinas source), *estimated*, *arithmetic* or *chosen*. A claim the design leans on that nobody has tested is marked **[unverified]**.

Each page ends with what it decides. The identifiers there (D93, A27) point into the book's [design register](../../notes/design-register.md), one table of every decision (D) with the alternative it rejected, and every assumption (A) with its standing, across both hosts. *Kept* means a decision made for the Asterinas host holds here unchanged; *revised* means this chapter changed it. The register is an index; nothing in this chapter needs it to be understood.

## In this chapter

Background, for a reader new to either side:

- [Kernelets in brief](kernelets-in-brief.md): the two-layer kernel, API virtualization, and the vocabulary.
- [The Linux this chapter needs](background.md): tasks, the entry path, signals, address spaces, modules, program loaders, control groups.

The design, in the order of the book's main [Design](../design/index.md) chapter:

- [Boundaries and trust](principles.md): the parties, the interfaces, the threat model, the invariants.
- [Builds and images](builds-and-images.md): one source, one shared text, many instances; what the build checks.
- [The kernelet API: control half](kernelet-api-control.md): identity, configuration, the life cycle, the endovisor's records.
- [The kernelet API: service half](kernelet-api-service.md): the twenty-one services, and what each becomes on Linux.
- [Virtualizing OSTD](virtualizing-ostd/index.md): the map, and then the mechanisms.
  - [Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md)
  - [Tasks, scheduling, and CPUs](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md)
  - [Interrupts and time](virtualizing-ostd/interrupts-and-time.md)
  - [User mode](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md)
  - [Devices](virtualizing-ostd/devices.md)
  - [Boot, power, panic, and the rest](virtualizing-ostd/the-rest.md)
- [Faults, termination, and reclamation](faults-and-reclamation.md): stopping a kernelet that will not cooperate, and giving everything back.
- [Channels](channels.md): vsock through a switch.
- [Zero-copy I/O](zero-copy-io.md): lending frames to Linux's block layer and sockets.
- [The endovisor](endovisor.md): the module, the patch, the device node, the life of a sandbox.
- [The kernelet runtime](kernelet-runtime.md): an OCI runtime over the endovisor.

And what stands behind it:

- [Alternatives considered](alternatives.md): what lost, and why.
- [The prototype](prototype.md): what has been verified by code.
