# Virtualizing OSTD

*The middle of the design: for each part of OSTD's interface that the kernel proper uses, what it becomes inside a kernelet on Linux. This page gives the classification and the whole map on one table; the seven pages below it give the mechanisms.*

## Three kinds of item

The kernel proper is written against OSTD's public interface: a few hundred types, functions and macros. vOSTD offers the same interface, and sorts every item into one of three kinds.

- **Identical.** The item's code is the same in vOSTD as in OSTD, because its effect is local to the kernelet: a spin lock, a reference-counted frame handle, a page-table walk over the kernelet's own tables, the unwinder.
- **Virtualized.** The item keeps its name and signature and has a different body. Some virtualized items never leave the kernelet (reading per-CPU data, reading the clock page). The others call the **service table**, the fixed set of host functions a kernelet is handed when it starts ([service half](../kernelet-api-service.md)).
- **Absent.** The item does not exist in vOSTD, so a use of it fails to compile. Every absent item is something a tenant's kernel must never have: port I/O, the interrupt controller, the IOMMU, sending inter-processor interrupts.

The sorting is a property of the kernelet build. The item-by-item classification has 72 rows (*counted*): 26 identical, 38 virtualized, 7 absent, and one that is internal to OSTD; 22 of the virtualized ones never call the host at all. The book keeps that long table in one place, [with the Asterinas host](../../design/virtualizing-ostd/index.md), and it was counted for that host. Nothing in this chapter depends on reading it: the figure below covers every module of OSTD's interface, and each mechanism page names the items it virtualizes.

What the host changes is **what stands behind the service table**, and how the kernelet is given processors. vOSTD is compiled per host, from one source, with a build-time switch. For Linux it selects:

1. **OSTD's own task layer, identical, where the other host's build virtualizes it.** On the Asterinas host a kernelet task is a host thread, and creating, parking and waking one are service calls. On Linux a kernelet task is OSTD's own object, scheduled by the kernel proper's own scheduler, and what is virtualized is one level down: the *processor*. Starting a secondary CPU, idling, kicking another CPU and receiving an interrupt each have a vOSTD body ([Tasks](tasks.md), [Scheduling](scheduling.md), [Interrupts and time](interrupts-and-time.md)). The rows of the long table for tasks therefore move from *virtualized* to *identical* on this host;
2. how vOSTD finds the record of the virtual CPU it is running on (through Linux's current-task pointer, rather than a slot the Asterinas host maintains);
3. how the fallible copy routines reach tenant memory ([by walking the model](memory.md#copies), rather than by dereferencing the tenant's address);
4. the function-entry [stack check](../faults-and-reclamation.md#stack), which only Linux needs;
5. preemption guards that also [raise Linux's own preemption count](scheduling.md#cooperative).

The kernel proper is compiled from identical source on both.

Left: what the kernel proper uses, unchanged: Task and TaskOptions; the Scheduler trait, WaitQueue and the idle loop; UserMode execute; VmSpace and its cursors; VmReader and VmWriter; FrameAllocOptions; IrqLine and timers; IoMem; per-CPU data and preemption guards; println and poweroff. Middle: what vOSTD does: runs OSTD's own tasks and context switch, with stacks from a service call; idles and kicks virtual CPUs by service call; calls user_run; keeps a page table as a model; walks the model and copies through the direct map; allocates from the grant; takes virtual interrupts as pending bits and an upcall; makes one service call per register access; indexes per-CPU data by virtual CPU and mirrors its guard depth; calls log_write and stop. Right: what Linux provides: memory for stacks, and no knowledge of the tasks; one carrier per virtual CPU, asleep or awake; the gate in the entry path; a memory area whose fault handler fills Linux's page table from the model; nothing at all for copies; pages from the page allocator, charged to the sandbox's control group; the watch timer, high-resolution timers and wakeups; device models over files and sockets; its per-processor preemption count; a log ring and the end of the sandbox.">

## In this section

- [Memory](memory.md): grains from Linux's page allocator; the kernelet's page table as a model and Linux's as a cache of it; reaching tenant memory without dereferencing it.
- [Tasks, virtual CPUs, and carriers](tasks.md): the kernelet's own tasks, the carriers that are its processors, the root carrier, kernelet stacks, and the watch timer.
- [Scheduling](scheduling.md): the two levels, virtual interrupts and the upcall, and how a kernelet and Linux share a processor politely and within bounds.
- [Interrupts and time](interrupts-and-time.md): virtual interrupt lines, the clock page and deadlines.
- [User mode](user-mode.md): the gate, `user_run`, exceptions, and what a tenant can never reach.
- [Devices](devices.md): virtio over function calls, and device models over Linux's files and sockets.
- [Boot, power, panic, and the rest](the-rest.md): entry, exit, the log, panics, and the machine a kernelet can still touch.
