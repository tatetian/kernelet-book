# Boot, power, panic, and the rest

*The remaining pieces of OSTD's interface: how a kernelet starts and stops, where its log goes, what happens when it panics, and which parts of the machine it can still touch directly.*

## A kernelet is entered, not booted

There is no firmware, no boot loader and no processor bring-up. The endovisor [loads the image](../builds-and-images.md), prepares the shared pages, and the root carrier clones the carriers ([Tasks](tasks.md#root)). The carrier of virtual CPU 0 calls the image's entry point, `_kernelet_entry(services, boot_args)`, on a **boot stack**: a kernelet stack the endovisor takes from the sandbox's [stack pool](tasks.md#stacks) for each virtual CPU, which plays the part a processor's boot stack plays on a machine.

vOSTD's initialization is OSTD's with everything a machine needs removed. In order, it:

1. stores the service table pointer and reads the **boot arguments**, a read-only page whose full contents the [service half](../kernelet-api-service.md#pages) lists: the kernelet's identity, its number of virtual CPUs, the direct-map base, the locations of the other shared pages, the device list, the kernel command line, and the numbers by which vOSTD finds its way around Linux;
2. parses the command line and initializes logging;
3. reads the grant table and hands the initial runs to its frame allocator;
4. finds its per-CPU data, which the endovisor has already laid out: one copy of the image's `.cpu_local` section per virtual CPU, each a bitwise copy of the section's initial image, as OSTD requires, at the base the virtual CPU's record names;
5. turns virtual interrupts on (clears the record's `irq_off`, which the endovisor set before entry) so that no [virtual interrupt](interrupts-and-time.md) could be delivered before step 4;
6. runs the image's initializers, which is how the kernel proper's components register themselves;
7. calls the kernel proper's `main`.

**Boot information.** `boot::boot_info()` returns a record synthesized from the boot arguments: a boot-loader name of `"kernelet"`, the command line, and one usable memory region per initial run, so that the kernel proper's idea of total memory is its initial grant. There is no ACPI table, no framebuffer and no initial RAM disk; an initial file system arrives as a block device.

**Secondary processors.** On a machine, OSTD starts the other processors and runs a registered entry function on each. vOSTD does the same with the service `vcpu_boot(i)` in place of the processor's start-up sequence: the waiting carrier of virtual CPU *i* enters the image at the entry table's `vcpu_entry`, on its own boot stack, runs the entry function, and joins the scheduler. The virtual CPUs run concurrently with `main`, as processors do.

**When `main` returns.** OSTD's start-up code calls `Task::yield_now()` after `main`, from a context that is not itself a task, and on a machine that call never returns: the scheduler switches to the first task and the boot context is left behind for good. It is the same code here, and the boot stack is simply not used again. (The call returns only if the run queue is empty; the kernel proper avoids that by spawning an idle task per CPU before it gets there, and a kernel that injects a scheduler must do the same.) A virtual CPU with nothing to run is idled as the kernel proper idles a processor, by a task of its own that calls OSTD's `halt_cpu()`; in vOSTD that function is the service `vcpu_idle` ([Interrupts and time](interrupts-and-time.md)).

## Power

`power::poweroff(code)` and `power::restart()` become the service [`stop`](../kernelet-api-service.md#abi) with the kind `KLET_STOP_EXIT`, the code, and no message. It never returns. The endovisor marks the kernelet dying, records the exit code, and [ends every carrier](../faults-and-reclamation.md). The runtime learns the code from the endovisor's device. A restart is an exit whose code has its top bit set, which asks the runtime to create the sandbox again.

## Log and console

`log_write(level, module, text)` hands a record of at most 1 KiB to the endovisor, which copies it into a per-sandbox ring that the runtime reads, and drops records beyond the sandbox's configured bytes per second. A kernelet's log does not go to Linux's own log by default: a tenant must not be able to flood the operator's console or push the operator's messages out of the kernel's ring. The prototype, which has one kernelet and no runtime, sends it to `printk`.

## Panic

A panic on one task of the kernel proper is caught by the kernel proper itself, which ends that task and carries on; vOSTD reports it with the service `oops` so that the endovisor can count it against the sandbox's **oops budget**. A panic nothing catches reaches vOSTD's panic handler, which calls `stop` with the kind `KLET_STOP_PANIC` and the message. Unwinding inside a kernelet uses the image's own unwind tables and never crosses into Linux.

## The machine a kernelet can still touch

A kernelet runs in kernel mode, so nothing in hardware stops its code from executing a privileged instruction. What stops it is that the kernel proper cannot express one: it is safe Rust, and vOSTD, the only code in the image that may use `unsafe`, does not offer it one.

| OSTD item | in vOSTD on Linux |
|---|---|
| CPU feature queries | identical: the `cpuid` instruction, read directly |
| timestamp counter | identical: `rdtsc`, read directly |
| port I/O, the interrupt controller, the IOMMU, PCI, ACPI | absent: a use does not compile |
| enabling and disabling interrupts | virtualized: the architecture primitives behind the interrupts-off guard, the context switch and `halt_cpu` set and restore the virtual CPU's `irq_off` ([Scheduling](scheduling.md#upcall)); the hardware flag is never touched |
| sending inter-processor interrupts | virtualized as `vcpu_kick`; remote TLB flushes go through [`tlb_shootdown`](memory.md#cache) |
| FS and GS base of a tenant thread | virtualized: OSTD's `FsBase` and `GsBase` write vOSTD's per-task context, which `user_run` applies ([User mode](user-mode.md#fpu)) |
| floating-point and vector state | never used by kernelet code; a tenant thread's is saved and loaded by the kernel proper through `FpuContext`, which is two services ([User mode](user-mode.md#fpu)) |
| per-CPU data (`cpu_local!`) | virtualized: the base of this virtual CPU's copy is read from its record, not from a segment register, which is Linux's |

## What this page decides

- **A kernelet's log goes to a per-sandbox ring, rate-limited, not to Linux's log** (register D103). The alternative is simpler and lets any tenant write to the operator's console.
- **Virtual CPUs start and idle as processors do, through `vcpu_boot` and `vcpu_idle`** (register D116). With OSTD's own task layer in the build, `yield_now` from the boot context needs no special meaning, and register D104, which gave it one, is withdrawn.
