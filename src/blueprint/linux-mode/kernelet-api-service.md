# The kernelet API: service half

*The complete list of what a running kernelet can ask of its host, given as the C interface it is, and what each request becomes on Linux. This table is the boundary: what is not on it, a kernelet cannot do.*

## What the service half is

A kernelet image has no undefined symbols, so it cannot call Linux. When the endovisor enters an image it passes a pointer to the **service table**: a C structure of twenty-one function pointers, the same for every kernelet on the machine. vOSTD calls through it whenever a [virtualized item](virtualizing-ostd/index.md) needs something only the host can give. Each such call is a **crossing**: an indirect function call at the same privilege, with no trap and no address-space switch. *Measured on the booted prototype* of the Asterinas host, a crossing cost 35 cycles against 34 for a plain call; on Linux a crossing also changes stacks ([below](#depth)), which *measured on the booted prototype* of this design at under ten cycles for the pair of switches.

The image exports the mirror image, an **entry table**, which is how the endovisor enters the image. The two tables, the shared pages and the constants are the **image ABI**. It is defined once, in a Rust module that vOSTD compiles, and the C header below is generated from that module; the endovisor's build fails if any size or offset disagrees.

The ABI has two parts. The services for memory, devices, output and the end of a kernelet's life are the same whichever kernel is the host. The services that stand for *the processor* are this host's own: on Linux a kernelet is given [virtual CPUs](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md) and runs its own tasks on them, so where the Asterinas host's table has calls to create, park and wake host threads, this one has calls to start, idle and kick virtual CPUs.

Three rules shape every function in the table.

- **Arguments are integers**: virtual CPU numbers, device numbers, physical addresses, lengths. A physical address is checked against the kernelet's grant before it is used.
- **No function returns a result through a pointer**, with two exceptions that are named below and range-checked. Results come back in registers. A host that wrote through a kernelet-supplied pointer would be writing wherever a buggy vOSTD told it to.
- **The host keeps no pointer into a kernelet after a call returns.** Its tables hold identifiers and physical addresses.

The endovisor never sees a closure or a task of the kernelet. It enters the image in three ways only: at the entry point, at `vcpu_entry`, and by [redirecting an interrupted virtual CPU](virtualizing-ostd/scheduling.md#upcall) to `virq_entry`; it checks at registration that both addresses lie in the image's text.

## Who is calling {#depth}

No service takes a "which kernelet" argument, because a kernelet must not be able to claim to be another. The endovisor finds the caller from Linux: the current task's [gate pointer](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md#gate) leads to its **carrier record**, which names the kernelet and the virtual CPU, and holds the **service-call depth** and the saved stack pointers of the [stack switch](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#stacks). The carrier record is endovisor memory, which nothing in the kernel proper can name. (The virtual CPU's *shared* record, above, is a different object: it is what the two sides use to talk, and nothing in it is believed for a decision that protects the host, except as stated under [The shared pages](#pages).)

Every service function is wrapped in the same prologue and epilogue.

**On the way in**: find the carrier record; if the kernelet is marked dying, do not return to it at all but [leave the kernelet for good](faults-and-reclamation.md#leaving) (`stop` is exempt); take out of Linux's preemption count whatever the kernelet's guards have added to it ([why they add to it](virtualizing-ostd/scheduling.md#cooperative)), and remember how much; switch to the carrier's Linux stack; set the depth to 1; count the call for the sandbox's statistics.

**On the way out**: set the depth to 0; if the kernelet was marked dying meanwhile, leave for good instead of returning; re-arm the [watch timer](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#watch) if needed; switch back to the kernelet stack; put the remembered amount back into Linux's count.

How much the guards have added is not something the endovisor asks the kernelet. A carrier enters kernelet code, by any of the three ways in, with Linux's count at a value the endovisor records; in task context, whatever the count exceeds that value by is the kernelet's doing. Every place that takes a carrier out of kernelet code, a service prologue, the [yield stubs](virtualizing-ostd/tasks.md#yield) and the [exit stub](faults-and-reclamation.md#leaving), restores the recorded value by that arithmetic, so a kernelet that miscounts its guards cannot leave Linux's count wrong behind it.

The depth is 1 exactly while the carrier, having come from kernelet code, is inside endovisor or Linux code and may hold their locks. It is one of the two tests that make [eviction](faults-and-reclamation.md#eviction) safe.

**Which calls give up the processor.** `vcpu_idle`, `vcpu_yield`, `vcpu_on_spin` and `user_run` exist to let something else run: in the first three Linux may run another task on this processor, and in the last the tenant runs. OSTD makes them with its guards in a known state (`execute` takes one guard on purpose, and idling holds none); a call that arrives with more guards held than that is refused with `-KLET_STATE`. That check reads the `masked` depth, which the kernelet writes, so it protects the kernelet from its own bugs and not the host from the kernelet. `user_run` can also block in Linux before it leaves, when it has to create the [memory area](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#cache) of an address space it is the first to run in.

**Which calls can block inside Linux.** `grains_request` and `kstack_alloc` while Linux allocates memory, and `tlb_shootdown` while it waits for fault handlers to finish. The virtual CPU simply does not run meanwhile, as a processor that waits for a TLB flush does not. `tlb_shootdown` cannot be allowed to fail, so it is never refused.

A carrier inside a service call cannot be [evicted](faults-and-reclamation.md#eviction), so the endovisor owes a bound on every one of them. The rule is that **every sleep inside a service is killable**: the waits use Linux's killable forms, and the sweep's `SIGKILL` ends them. The remaining services do bounded work without sleeping.

**Stack.** A service call does not run on a kernelet stack. Each entry in the table is a short stub in the endovisor that switches to the carrier's Linux stack, runs the prologue, the service and the epilogue there, and switches back. Linux's code then runs on the stack it was written for, one that Linux's overflow detection and backtraces know about, and how deep a service goes into Linux no longer depends on how deep the kernelet was when it called. The Linux stack is nearly empty at that moment: it holds only the frames of the gate hook or start function that entered the kernelet.

## What each service becomes on Linux

| service | on Linux |
|---|---|
| `grains_request` | page allocator, charged to the sandbox's control group; zero; record in the owner array, then publish in the grant table ([Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md)) |
| `pt_root_register` | check that the root frame is in the grant; create the model's record, its file object, and a Linux address space for it |
| `pt_root_unregister` | refused while a virtual CPU has the model activated; otherwise empty its cache and release its Linux address space. vOSTD calls it only when the last task has let go of the address space, and must not reuse the root frame until it has returned |
| `pt_activate` | record the model as this virtual CPU's current tenant address space; the carrier adopts the corresponding Linux address space at the next `user_run` |
| `tlb_shootdown` | wait out fault handlers on this model, then `unmap_mapping_range()` on the model's file ([Memory](virtualizing-ostd/memory.md#interlock)) |
| `kstack_alloc`, `kstack_free` | a `vmalloc` range with guard pages, charged to the sandbox; bounded by the sandbox's task limit |
| `vcpu_boot` | wake the carrier of that virtual CPU, which enters the image at `vcpu_entry` |
| `vcpu_idle` | killable, freezable sleep until a bit is pending, the deadline passes, or the kernelet is dying |
| `vcpu_kick` | set KICK; wake the carrier if it is idle, [flag it](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md#gate) if it is in user mode |
| `vcpu_yield` | `cond_resched()`, then `schedule()` if Linux still wants the processor |
| `vcpu_on_spin` | [`yield_to()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12/source/kernel/sched/syscalls.c#L1468) a sibling carrier that is runnable and not running, if there is one |
| `timer_arm` | re-arm the virtual CPU's `hrtimer`, no sooner than 50 µs from now ([Interrupts and time](virtualizing-ostd/interrupts-and-time.md)) |
| `user_run` | adopt the address space, switch to the Linux stack and return to user mode through the gate ([User mode](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md#user-run)) |
| `fpu_save`, `fpu_load` | under Linux's `fpregs_lock()`, make the user floating-point registers live if they are not, then save them to, or load them from, the kernelet's buffer ([User mode](virtualizing-ostd/user-mode.md#fpu)) |
| `mmio_read`, `mmio_write` | check device, offset and width (1, 2, 4 or 8); call the device model ([Devices](virtualizing-ostd/devices.md)) |
| `log_write` | copy at most 1 KiB into the sandbox's log ring, rate-limited |
| `oops` | count a caught panic against the oops budget |
| `stop` | mark dying with the kind, code and message; the calling carrier then [leaves for good](faults-and-reclamation.md#leaving) from inside the service, which is why the call never returns |

**Pointers.** Six services take one. `user_run`'s context must lie on the current kernelet stack, and the endovisor copies it rather than using it in place. `fpu_save` and `fpu_load` name a buffer in kernelet memory; together with `user_run`'s context they are the only places where the host writes into a kernelet, and it does so with Linux's non-faulting kernel copy after checking that the range lies in the instance's data, a kernelet stack, or the grant. The text arguments of `log_write`, `oops` and `stop` are read the same way ([`copy_from_kernel_nofault()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12/source/mm/maccess.c#L24)), so a bad pointer is `-KLET_INVALID` and never a host fault.

## The shared pages {#pages}

Some information is cheaper to read than to ask for. The endovisor maps five kinds of page after each instance's data; all are read-only to the kernelet except the last.

| page | contents | written |
|---|---|---|
| **boot arguments** | identity, number of virtual CPUs, direct-map base, metadata base, where the other pages are, device list, command line, the two offsets vOSTD needs to find its records from Linux's current-task pointer, and the per-processor location of Linux's preemption count | once, before entry |
| **grant table** | the base and length of each run | appended by the endovisor when it grants |
| **info page** | the number of runs in the grant table, the grant's ceiling | by the endovisor |
| **clock page** | coarse ticks and monotonic nanoseconds; one page for the whole machine | by one machine-wide timer |
| **virtual CPU records** | `struct klet_vcpu_rec`, one per virtual CPU | by both, as its comments say |

What the endovisor believes from a virtual CPU's record is limited and deliberate. It believes `masked` for one purpose: whether to redirect to the upcall now or leave the bit pending, which affects only the kernelet. It believes `stack_limit` not at all; vOSTD's own entry check reads it. The service-call depth, the dying mark, Linux's preemption count and everything else that protects the host are in endovisor memory or in Linux's. The header above gives the tables and the record in full; the byte layouts of the other pages are fixed by the same generated header and are not reproduced here.

## What is not offered

There is no service to read or write host memory, to map anything, to allocate a frame by address, to disable interrupts, to send an interrupt to a processor, to load a page table into the processor, to change a carrier's Linux priority, class or affinity, or to call a host function by address. Their absence from the table is what makes them absent from a kernelet. The image cannot name what the table does not contain.

## What this page decides

- **The service table's memory, device and output groups are the same on both hosts; its processor group is this host's own: virtual CPUs in place of host threads** (register D116; D2 and D65 kept). A kernelet image for Linux is built from the same source, with OSTD's own task layer in place of the virtualized one.
- **Service calls run on the carrier's Linux stack, with the kernelet's guard depth taken out of Linux's preemption count for their duration** (register D112, D119).
- **The caller is identified through Linux's current task, and the depth and dying state live in endovisor memory** (register D7 and D8, adapted). The alternative, state in shared pages, would let a kernelet make itself unstoppable.
