# Executive Summary

This book is written for two kinds of reader, and it tries to serve both without shortchanging either.

**Asterinas developers** will build this. For them the book is a specification, [The Blueprint](blueprint/index.md), written to be precise enough that a coding agent can work from it.

**Academic readers** will judge it. For them the book is the long form of a paper, [The Paper](paper/abstract.md), with the design's costs, its limits and what has not been verified stated as plainly as its claims.

The two pitches below are the same idea told to each audience.

## The pitch to industry {#industry}

> **Give every agent its own kernel.**

**Agents are multiplying. Every one of them needs its own computer, one it cannot escape.**

Agents install dependencies, run tests, compile code, drive browsers. They don't need a function runtime; they need a full Linux machine that can be torn down and rebuilt at will. Sandboxing has gone from an ops option to a primitive of AI infrastructure, and every sandbox available today is either not fast enough or not strong enough.

A kernelet is a complete, Linux-compatible kernel light-weight enough to give one to every agent. Asterinas runs many kernelets side by side inside a single host kernel, each written in safe Rust and each serving one tenant, so unmodified Linux applications get a kernel of their own. VMs pay a price for hardware isolation; kernelets don't. Containers share a kernel; kernelets don't.

## The pitch to academia {#academia}

> **API virtualization: a third way between machine virtualization and OS virtualization.**

Two ways of multiplexing a machine among mutually distrusting tenants have dominated for twenty years. **Machine virtualization** runs an unmodified guest kernel on virtual hardware; the boundary is the hardware's, strong and well understood, and the price is a second layer of address translation, VM exits, a device model, and a whole guest kernel's memory and scheduler per tenant. **OS virtualization** multiplexes one kernel through namespaces and control groups; the price is near zero, and the boundary is the correctness of thirty million lines of C that every tenant can drive through the full syscall table.

Asterinas Kernelets are a third point in that space, and this book calls the idea **API virtualization**: rather than virtualizing the hardware beneath a kernel, or multiplexing one kernel above its syscall table, it virtualizes the interface a kernel is written against. The Asterinas kernel is a *framekernel*: all `unsafe` code lives in a small framework, OSTD, and the kernel above it is safe Rust written against OSTD's API. A **kernelet** is that kernel, unmodified, compiled against **vOSTD**, a build of OSTD's own source in which every operation's effect is confined to the kernelet that makes it, and whatever a kernelet must never have does not exist. The boundary is the language, not the hardware: the crate graph decides what a kernelet can name, and a table of C-ABI calls decides what may cross. Each tenant gets a kernel of its own, and the machine underneath stays real; the price is that the boundary rests on the compiler and on OSTD's soundness.

## How to read this book {#how-to-read}

You need to know Rust and roughly how an operating-system kernel is put together. Nothing else is assumed. The book is three volumes, and they are meant to be read in the order that suits the reader rather than the order they were written in.

- [**The Paper**](paper/abstract.md) is the idea in its most concise form, written as a research paper.
- [**The Blueprint**](blueprint/index.md) is the design document, written so that a coding agent can implement from it.
- [**The Notes**](notes/index.md) hold the working material behind the other two.

Logically the Notes came first, the Blueprint was built from them, and the Paper was distilled from the Blueprint.

If you read only one volume, read the Paper. If you will build it, read the Blueprint.
