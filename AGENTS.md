# Working on the Asterinas Kernelets book

This file is for any agent or person editing the book in this directory. Read it before touching `src/`. Where a rule needs a reason, the reason is given with it; the history of the text is in git.

## What the book is

A design specification that a coding agent can implement from, and the long form of a research paper. Both readings have to hold at once: every mechanism is stated concretely enough to build, and every claim carries its evidence.

## Vocabulary

Use exactly these words, and use them consistently:

| term | meaning |
|---|---|
| **kernelet** | one instance of the Asterinas kernel compiled against the OSTD-shaped API, in ring 0, in the same image as every other kernelet |
| **sandbox** | one tenant's environment: a kernelet plus the user-space processes it serves; what a VM or a container is to its tenant |
| **host kernel (or host)** | the first instance of the Asterinas kernel that boots the machine and runs init and the host user space; the same source as kernelet, built against OSTD, but with different configurations |
| **endovisor** | the component inside the host kernel that creates, schedules, destroys and mediates kernelets; *endo-* because it sits inside the host kernel and beside the kernelets, whereas a hypervisor sits beneath its guests |
| **kernelet runtime** | the user-space program on the host that creates and configures sandboxes, as a container runtime does |

## Voice and honesty

- American spelling: virtualization, behavior, artifact.
- Every number says where it came from: *measured on the booted prototype*, *measured on the tree* (Asterinas at commit `ab9a4cfdc`), *measured in a model*, or *estimated*. A load-bearing claim that is unverified is marked **[unverified]**.

## Structure

- `src/SUMMARY.md` is the single source of order and numbering. The Executive Summary is an unnumbered prefix chapter; everything else is numbered by mdBook in order.
- Every chapter directory has an `index.md`. Where the original section had a preamble, that is the page; otherwise it is a short summary plus the list of subsections (mdBook does not generate a child list on the parent page, so the list is written by hand and must be kept in step with `SUMMARY.md`).
- Files are named for their content, never numbered. Numbers live only in `SUMMARY.md` order.
- Unwritten material is a `> **To be written.** …` blockquote stating scope and sources, never invented content.

## Cross-references and links

- Section references are links whose text is a `§` number: `[§4.1.3](../design/process/switch-policy.md)`. **Never type the number by hand.** After any change to `SUMMARY.md`, or to the `##` headings of a chapter that has no child pages, run `make renumber`; it re-derives every `§` text from the table of contents.
- A term used on a page but defined on another may be linked on its first use, with the term itself as the link text: `[owner array](../memory/frames.md)`. That is the preferred way to make a page self-contained; do not rewrite sentences for it.
- Links go to files (`…/switch-policy.md`), or to explicit `{#id}` heading anchors. Give a heading an explicit id whenever something links to it; do not rely on mdBook's slug rules.
- Index pages are `index.md`, never `README.md`: mdBook 0.5 renders a `README.md` chapter as `index.html` but rewrites links to a `README.html` that does not exist. The checker rejects such links.

## Theme

`assets/kernelets.css` (via `additional-css`) rebrands mdBook's `navy` theme with the figure palette and `assets/mermaid-init.js` gives Mermaid a matching `base` theme for dark modes; both are described in the header comment of `assets/kernelets.css`. Light themes are left as mdBook ships them. When adding a component style, scope it under `.navy` and use the `--k-*` variables; do not override `theme/` templates.

## Diagrams and figures

- Diagrams in the design chapters are Mermaid in ```` ```mermaid ```` fences, rendered by `mdbook-mermaid`. Node ids must not be words the checker maps (the host-kernel node is `hk`, not `host`).
- The two figures on the Executive Summary are inline SVG inside `<figure class="fwd-fig">`, styled by `assets/fig.css`. Inside an HTML block there must be **no blank line**, or CommonMark resumes Markdown parsing mid-block. Prefix SVG gradient ids (`fwd-…`) so the single-page `print.html` has no id collisions.

## Workflow

```sh
# from the repository root; each target is one command, listed in the Makefile
make renumber   # after editing SUMMARY.md or ## headings in single-file chapters
make check      # must print "check: OK"
make build      # must exit 0; the mdbook-mermaid 0.5.0-vs-0.5.2 version warning is known and harmless
make            # check, then build
```

`check` verifies that every internal link resolves to an existing file and anchor, that no bare `§` is left unlinked (except inside code fences), that no chapter file is orphaned or missing, and that no link targets a `README.md`.

To confirm that Mermaid or an SVG figure actually renders, run `make render PAGE=<path under book/>` (for example `PAGE=design/process/two-windows.html`). It builds the book, screenshots the page to `.cache/render/`, and fails if any Mermaid block on the page did not render; look at the screenshot. The script finds a headless Chrome or fetches one into the gitignored `.cache/` directory, and installs nothing outside the repository. Pass `OUT=<file.png>` to put the screenshot elsewhere, such as the scratchpad.

**Adding a section**

1. Write the file under the right directory, starting with `# Title`. Refer to other sections as `[§](path.md)` with any or no number in the text.
2. Add one line to `src/SUMMARY.md` at the right place and depth; if it is a subsection, add it to the parent's `index.md` list too.
3. Run `make renumber`, then `make`.

**Changing existing text.** Prefer adding a link or a new paragraph. If an existing sentence must change, say which sentence and why in the commit message, or ask; the owner reviews wording closely.

**Before finishing a pass.** The commit message says what changed, what was verified (quote the actual command output) and what the next pass should attack. When a decision in this file is made or reversed, edit this file in the same commit.
